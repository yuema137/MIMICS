# MIMICS
Medical Imaging Monte carlo Integrated Chain Simulator. This Repo provides full-chain simulations and reconstructions for prototypes of:
- SPECT
- PET
- CT
- Combinations, i.e. SPECT/CT, PET/CT

## Modules
- `G4Sim`: GEANT4 simulation for energy deposit
- `Analysis`: Python scripts and notebooks for data analysis and visualization
- `PySim`: Python simulation for further conversions (electron-hole generation and propogations in semiconductor, sintillations in scintilators, etc.)
- `Reconstruction`: Traditional Reconstruction Algorithms with Python
- `MLRec`: Example ML projects with simulated data
